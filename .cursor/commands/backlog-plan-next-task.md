# Plan the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column (without "Planned" label)

## Overview

Take the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column (without "Planned" label) and plan it.

## Steps

1. Check the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column without the "Planned" label.

1.1. If there is no task in the "To Do" column OR if all these tasks have the "Planned" label, STOP at this step with a message "No task to plan in the To Do column".

2. Display clearly in the output the task you pickled (display at least its id (example: Task-1234) and its title).

3. Move the task to the "In Progress" column.

4. Switch to plan mode.

5. Read the task and plan it (in plan mode). Use any information you find in the task as instructions. You can ask some questions to human if it's not clear enough. Present your plan to human and wait for an explicit validation before continuing.

6. DON'T IMPLEMENT THE TASK! After the human validation, use the validated plan to fill or complete at least the "Acceptance Criteria" and the "Implementation Plan" in the backlog.md task (through MCP). You can also use "Implementation Notes" section but don't use "Definition of Done" section (we don't use it).

7. Add the "Planned" label to the task.

8. Keep the task in the "In Progress" column.
