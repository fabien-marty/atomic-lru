# Implement the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column (with "Planned" label)

## Overview

Take the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column (with "Planned" label) and implement it.

## Steps

1. Check the next task from backlog.md "To Do" column with the "Planned" label.

1.1. If there is no task in the "To Do" column OR if there is no task with the "Planned" label, STOP at this step with a message "No task found in the To Do column with the Planned label".

2. Display clearly in the output the task you pickled (display at least its id (example: Task-1234) and its title).

3. Move the task to the "In Progress" column.

4. Execute/implement the task.

5. After the implementation is done and acceptance criteria are met, fill the "Implementation Notes" section with what you have done.

6. Add the "Implemented" label to the task.

7. Keep the task in the "In Progress" column.
