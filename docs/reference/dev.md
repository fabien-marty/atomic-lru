# DEV

This library is managed with `uv` and a `Makefile`. Execute:

- `uv sync` to create the virtual environment
- `make lint` to lint the code (style, checks, types, architecture) and fix obvious things
- `make test` to execute unit tests
- `make doc` to generate the documentation

See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ to install `uv` if you need to.
